    <h1>Html</h1>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web <br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

        <h1>Css</h1>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br> This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the . <br>css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
